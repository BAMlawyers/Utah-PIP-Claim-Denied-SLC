# What to Do If Your PIP Claim Is Denied in Salt Lake City, Utah

PIP (Personal Injury Protection) coverage is mandatory in Utah under § 31A-22-307. It is a no-fault benefit, meaning your auto insurer is required to pay regardless of who caused the crash.

If your PIP claim is denied in Salt Lake City, this guide—authored by BAM Personal Injury Lawyers—will walk you through the reasons, remedies, timelines, statutes, and strategies to get it reversed or escalated.

## Quick Answer

A PIP denial is often invalid under Utah law. Many are based on:
- Pretextual defenses (e.g., "not related to the accident")
- Improper medical necessity denials
- Administrative pretexts (e.g., “application incomplete”)
- Failure to respond within statutory deadlines

You have the right to challenge denials and **file formal complaints** with the Utah Insurance Department or through a lawsuit against the insurer with an attorney.

### *What is the appeal deadline?*

Insurers must respond to appeals within **30 days**. Failure to do so may constitute bad faith and expose the carrier to further liability.

---

### *Can the insurer deny based on IME or peer review?*

Only if conducted by a **licensed Utah physician in the correct specialty**. See **Utah Admin Code R590-190-9**. Otherwise, the denial is challengable.

---

### *Can I still sue the at-fault driver if PIP is denied?*

Yes, **but only if**:
- Your medical expenses exceed $3,000 (the PIP limit); or
- You meet a **tort threshold** under **§ 31A-22-309(1)(a)** (e.g., permanent disability, fracture, disfigurement)

## Strategic Tips

- **Document every communication** with the insurance adjuster.
- **Never rely on verbal denials**—get everything in writing.
- If your claim was denied due to **“not medically necessary”**, demand the name and credentials of the reviewer.
- Engage an attorney if denial persists beyond one appeal cycle.
